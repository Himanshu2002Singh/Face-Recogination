 2. Tkinter(Available in python)
 3. PIL (pip install Pillow)
 4. Pandas(pip install pandas)
 
# What steps you have to follow??
  1. Download my Repository
  2. Create a TrainingImage folder in a project.
  3. Open a AMS_Run.py and change the all paths with your system path
  4. Run AMS_Run.py.

# What steps you have to follow??

 1.  Download or clone my Repository to your device
 2.  type pip install -r requirements.txt in command prompt(this will install required package for project)

# Notes

 1. It will require high processing power(I have 8 GB RAM & 2 GB GC)
 2. If you think it will recognise person just like humans,than leave it ,its not possible.
 3. Noisy image can reduce your accuracy so quality of images matter.
